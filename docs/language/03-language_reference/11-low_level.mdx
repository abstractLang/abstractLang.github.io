Abstractions are made to make the programmer's life easier, symplifying
repedititve or system-dependent tasks.

Sometimes however, it is mandatory to communicate directly with the system.
Embedded and bare-metal development, system programming and better memory
managing are just some examples of why this access is needed.

## Inline Assembly

The target will provide a library with interfaces to allow this
connection.

As a example of use, being targeted to x86_64 assemby:

```abs
from Std.Console import
from Std.System.Assembly.x86_64Assembly import {
    Instructions as opcode,
    ReferenceOperators as refas
}

func foo()
{

	let string message = "Hello, World!";

	opcode.MOV(.RDI, refas.memptr(message))
	opcode.CALL(refas.memptr(writeln))

}

```
