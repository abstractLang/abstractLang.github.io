# Metaprogramming

:::info[Under Construction]
:::

Metaprogramming is the process of writing code that can create, modify,
or analyze other parts of the code or itself, often leveraging the structure
and behavior of the code to automate tasks, enhance flexibility, or enable
dynamic behavior at runtime or compile time.

Abstract offers metaprogramming as a resource to modify the behavior of
functions and subroutines or structures, generate code at compilation time
and optimize certain portions of the code.
