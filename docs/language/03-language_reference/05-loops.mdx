# Loops
:::under-construction

Complex programs aways needs to do repetitive or infinite tasks. Because of it,
loops must be used. Loops are structures used to repeat a selected code section
until some condition is reached. Bellow are the loop types that abstract supports:

## While loops
:::not-implemented

While loops are the most basic loop types. It while it conditional is valid or
the code reaches a breakpoint.

This is the structure of a while syntax:
```abs
while <condition> => <instruction>
```

While loops do not have iterators, so in this cse we must create our own:
```abs
let index = 10
while index >= 0 => {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
	index -= 2
}
Std.Console.writeln(index)
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
0
```

Using a `break` statement, it is possible to stop the loop before it has reached
it condition:
```abs
let index = 10
while index >= 0 => {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
	index -= 2

	if index < 5 break
}
Std.Console.writeln(index)
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
4
```

Using `:` is also possible to define an extra step for the loop to do
after each iteration:

```abs
# Parenthesis are optional, but helps to read!
let index = 0
while (index < 10) : (index++) => Std.Console.log("Hello, World!")
```

## For loops
:::not-implemented
:::

// TODO

```abs
from Std.Console import

# Looping from 0 to 49
for i in ..50 => writeln(i)

# Looping from 0 to 50 in steps of 10
for i in ..50:10 => writeln(i)

# Looping though each element of a array
let []byte numbers = [22, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
for v in numbers => {
	write("Example of a prime number:")
	writeln(v)
}
```
