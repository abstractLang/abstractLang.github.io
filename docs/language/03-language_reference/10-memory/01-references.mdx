# Data References

When it comes to memory management, is important to understand what is data references
and dereferencing data before knowing how to use it.

---
In diverse cases, it's usefull, better for performance or just innavoidable to handle some
process with the data source instead of a copy of it. To solve this problem, all systems
allows two ways of moving data around:

### Sending Data By Value
means that the data being assigned is not the source, but a copy of it. Let's take a example:

```abs
const source = 10
const copy1 = source
const copy2 = source
```

both `copy1` and `copy2` have the same value stored in source: 10. It doesnt mean that `copy1`
and `copy2` are refering `source`.

```abs
from Std.Console import

const source = 10
const copy1 = source
const copy2 = source

writeln("original source = \{source}")
writeln("original copy1 = \{copy1}")
writeln("original copy2 = \{copy2}")

# Modifying...
copy2 = 20
copy1 = 5

writeln("source = \{source}")
writeln("copy1 = \{copy1}")
writeln("copy2 = \{copy2}")
```
```text title="Console Output"
original source = 10
original copy1 = 10
original copy2 = 10
source = 10
copy1 = 5
copy2 = 20
```

With this code is possible to see that `source`, `copy1` and `copy2` has independent values,
though receiving it from the same field reference. This is explained though the fact that
the computer makes a copy of the value in `source` instead of derreferencing the field itself.
This way, any modifications on data received by value will not be reflected in the original
data source.

### Sending Data By Reference
means that the data being assigned is a reference to the source. Follow the example:

```abs
const source = 10
const copy1 = source
const ref1 = &source
const ref2 = &source
```

The unary operator `&` returns the reference of the field instead of it value. This means that
`ref1` and `ref2` now *points* to `source`.

```abs
from Std.Console import

const source = 10
const copy1 = source
const ref1 = &source
const ref2 = &source

writeln("original source = \{source}")
writeln("original copy1 = \{copy1}")
writeln("original ref1 = \{ref1}")
writeln("original ref2 = \{ref2}")

# Modifying...
ref1 = 5
ref2 = 7

writeln("source = \{source}")
writeln("copy1 = \{copy1}")
writeln("ref1 = \{ref1}")
writeln("ref2 = \{ref2}")
```
```text title="Console Output"
original source = 10
original copy1 = 10
original ref1 = 10
original ref2 = 10
source = 7
copy1 = 10
ref1 = 7
ref2 = 7
```

This example shows that assiging a value to `ref2` resulted in both `source` and `ref2` being
changed to this value too. In reality, only the value of `source` is changing and it content is
being reflected by `ref1` and `ref2`.

## Understanding Pointers And Dereference

In computer origramming, pointers are a well-known and very usefull resource. It gives to the
program the hability to dynamically derreference a data in memory. Let`s abstract the pointer
concept into a little analogy?

#### Memory Street
Let`s suppose that our program is a street. each house is a variable stored on memory and is habitated
by it's value
```
[  #1  ][    #2   ][    #3   ][  #4   ][    #5   ][    #6   ]
[ Tom  ][ (empty) ][ (empty) ][ Marry ][ (empty) ][ (empty) ]
------------------------------------------------------------
--  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
------------------------------------------------------------
```

John is a new data that we want to be saved in our program. as we do not know what househe will prefer
to stay, we need to allocate his house while our program is still running.

Because of it, john is able to stay in anyone of the addresses 2, 3, 5 or 6. However, our program cannot
find the current addres of john as he is not living in a static address.

Becase o it, the best option is, after jhon moved ou to his new house, ask to one of his neighbours
by his address. As Tom and Marry have static addresses (1 and 4 respectivelly), we can ask to marry
to hold jhon address for us and, instead of directly visiting Jhon, visit Mary first to ask his address.

The same way, when our real program needs to know where a dynamically allocated data is being stored,
storing he address of this memory region is one of the best ways to be able to read and write this data.

## Abstracting

Alltrough pointers are usefull in many ways, handling them incorrectly can result in fatal errors and,
in the worst case, can cause undefined behaviors. Because of this double-edged sword, abstract focus on
minimize the necessity of handling manually with memory though the use of references instead of pointers.

References can be handled exactly as pointers, exept hat they not aways derreference. References are
optimized to evaluate during compile time, directly linking references whenever possible.
