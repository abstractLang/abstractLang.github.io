# Lifetime And Ownership

:::under-construction
:::

As part of the Abstract's philosophy, eficiency during memory management is one
of the main focus of the language. To help the user to do not get bothered with
the tiny details, as default, abstract uses a system based in lifetime and
ownership to determinate when data explicitly or implicitly allcated on the heap
can be safetly and automatically deallocated.

:::info
Don't confuse "lifetime and ownership" with "ownership and borrowing". The abstract
language do not include any kind of borrowing or a borrow checking.

## Understanding Lifetime

In a procedural language like abstract, every program beggins in a certain defined
point (the entry point function) and expands it process in a linear stack, usually
finishing at the same scope that it beggins. The same way as the language knows
where a method starts, ends or a data is sent in or out a function, it can understand
where these data is being used and where it is being discarted.

let's take the following code as an example:
```abs
func main() !void {
    const message1 = "Hello, World!"
    sayMessage(message1)
    let message2 = "Today is a good day."
    sayMessage(message2)
    message2 = "How are you going?"
    sayMessage(message2)
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
    Std.Console.writeln(msg)
}
```

With a fast analysis, is not hard to understand when a data reference becomes
inaccessible:

```abs
func main() !void {
	const message1 = "Hello, World!"
	sayMessage(message1)
	let message2 = "Today is a good day."
	sayMessage(message2)
	message2 = "How are you going?"
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message1` and `message2` becomes
	# out of scope after here
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
	Std.Console.writeln(msg)
	# `msg` becomes out of scope
	# after here
}
```

Also it is possible to go more further and identify when a reference is no
more used or it value has changed:

```abs
func main() !void {
	const message1 = "Hello, World!"
	sayMessage(message1)
	# `message1` is not used anymore
	let message2 = "Today is a good day."
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` current value is lost here
	message2 = "How are you going?"
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` is not more used
	# and becomes out of scope
	# after here
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
	Std.Console.writeln(msg)
	# `msg` is not more used
	# and becomes out of scope
	# after here
}
```

Knowing where variables are lost or get out of scope,
the best practice is aways request the data destruction
to make sure that any heap-allocated data from it is
well deallocated:

```abs
func main() !void {
	const message1 = "Hello, World!"
	sayMessage(message1)
	destroy message1 # `message1` is not used anymore

	let message2 = "Today is a good day."
	sayMessage(message2)
	destroy message2 # `message2` current value is lost here

	message2 = "How are you going?"
	sayMessage(message2)
	destroy message2

	# `message2` is not more used
	# and becomes out of scope
	# after here
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
	Std.Console.writeln(msg)
	# `msg` is not more used
	# and becomes out of scope
	# after here
}
```

# The Static Garbage Collector

However, abstract can ease the duty of cleaning up objects every single time it lifetime ends.

The language included a feature called The Static Garbage Collector, a garbage collector that acts in compile time and is developed to carefully 8nspect, select and delete references when their lifetime ends. Take the following example:

```abs
func main() !void {
	const message1 = "Hello, World!"
	sayMessage(message1)
	# `message1` is not used anymore
	let message2 = "Today is a good day."
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` current value is lost here
	message2 = "How are you going?"
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` is out of scope
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
	Std.Console.writeln(msg)
	# `msg` is out of scope
}
```

Even without any destructor calls, this code can finely be compiled and executed without any leaks, thanks to the static GC.


```abs title="Static GC post-processed code
func main() !void {
	const message1 = "Hello, World!"
	sayMessage(message1)
	# `message1` is not used anymore
	delete message1 # by static GC
	let message2 = "Today is a good day."
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` current value is lost here
	delete message2 # by static GC
	message2 = "How are you going?"
	sayMessage(message2)
	# `message2` is out of scope
	delete message2 # by static GC
}

func sayMessage(string msg) {
	Std.Console.writeln(msg)
	# `msg` is out of scope
 # Static GC does nothing here,
 # as `msg` is not owned by this
 # scope.
}
```

## `TODO`

as the same way as Abstract implicitly allocate on heap,
it have a simple system of lifetime and ownershiping to know
when to try to automatically deallocate these allocations made.

Knowing as every struct can implement a destructor, the language
will follow the use of variables inside functions.

When a variable is created inside a function, it data is owned by this function.
When a variable is returned by the function, it data is owned by the caller.

When a function returns (dies), all the references that was owned by it will
lose the ownership of this function.

When a value do not have any more owners, the destructor of this value type
is called.

All this proccess should be handled in compiling thme.

Data inside objects also have a lifetime, but tracked by the ownership of
the instance. When the instance dies and it destructor is called, it should
also call the destructor of it owned data.
